# PyStage

Scratch-like Python programming.

PyStage bridges the gap between [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and Python.

There are two main projects:

- PyStage itself: https://github.com/pystage/pystage
- The web converter: https://github.com/pystage/converter (which is online under https://convert.pystage.org)
